        <div class="p"><p>Michelle is a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in User Experience Design
            with a minor in German. She originally hails (ha!) from Ann Arbor, so she didn't have to travel very far to get there. Nowadays, she 
            goes home to do laundry and to catch up with her 4-year-old yellow lab, Tesla. <!--Tesla pic?-->
            Michelle grew up with three siblings, so her house was always pretty loud - she didn't mind, though!
            There was always an opportunity to do something with one of her sisters or brother, and she doesn't know
            what she would do without them. She is the fourth member of her family to have attended the University of Michigan.

                    <p>Telsa turned 4 years old in March 2021 and loves walks. She is scarily smart but regularly
                        bonks her head on the wall while playing fetch. 10/10 good girl.

        <div class="p"><p>This semester, Michelle is excited to have been able to take a Web Design, a Web Applications, and a Graphic Design course. Only in 
            the past few years did she discover her interest in design, whether it might take the form of graphic design, app design, or interior design.
            She's had a lot of fun learning the ropes of typography, color, accessibility, and conveying meaning through visuals. Outside of class,
            Michelle is heavily involved in the University of Michigan Women's Glee Club (WGC). For the past 2 years, she has been
            a section leader for the Alto 1s (second lowest treble voice part), and this past year she picked up the job of designing merch 
            for Club. Next year, Michelle will take over the position of Concert Manager, and will be in charge of planning the concert for each 
            semester (hopefully, she'll be able to sing in a real concert her final semester in Glee). Michelle is also a member of WGC's a capella 
            subset group, Midnight Blue. Once upon a time, she tried her hand at writing songs, but decided she would rather practice piano and sing the 
            songs that other people already wrote.
