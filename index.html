            </div>
            <p class='p'>Hey there! I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in User Experience Design
                with a minor in German. I originally hail (ha!) from Ann Arbor, so I didn't have to travel very far to get to college. Nowadays, I 
                goes home to do laundry and to catch up with my yellow lab, Tesla. I have three siblings, so I never had a dull 
                moment growing up- I definitely didn't mind, though! There was always an opportunity to do something with one of my sisters or brother, 
                and I don't know what I would do without them.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class='p'>This semester, I am excited to have been able to take a Web Design, a Web Applications, and a Graphic Design course. Only in 
                the past few years did I discover an interest in design. I've had a lot of fun learning the ropes of typography, color, accessibility, and 
                conveying meaning through visuals. Outside of class, I am heavily involved in the University of Michigan Women's Glee Club (WGC). For the past 2 years, I have been
                a section leader for the Alto 1s (second lowest treble voice part), and this past year I picked up the job of designing merch 
                for Club. Next year, I will take over the position of Concert Manager, and will be in charge of planning the concert for each 
                semester (hopefully, I'll be able to sing in another real concert by the time I graduate). I'm also a member of WGC's a capella 
                subset group, Midnight Blue. Our virtual concert will soon be posted online!

        <p class='hidden'>I loved to travel with my family pre-pandemic - my mom had to travel for conferences a lot, and sometimes
            the rest of us got to tag along. I was lucky to be able to visit Switzerland for a week in Summer 2019 as a part
            of my mom's conference! Pictured below are some of the mountains we went hiking in.

        <p>Now <a href=''>here's a little game</a> for you! This picture you see here is from a trip I took a few summers ago. 
        You get to guess where I went! You'll get one hint: this is a National Park that is well known for its unique
        rock formations. Once you have a guess, hit 'tab' or hover your mouse over the image to reveal the answer! Good luck!</p>
