            <p class='p flex-spot'>My most recent design assignment was to create an A-Z poster of a specific topic of my choice-
                I chose to use characters from Studio Ghibli movies. Creating the positions of each
                character on the modular grid was the most time-consuming aspect of this poster,
                but once I finally finished the layout, completing the rest was a breeze. The result is a 
                combination of all of my Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator skills to date- the time I spend
                reworking and perfecting my poster was worth it! Take a look!

            <p class='p flex-spot'>I've been writing stories since I was about 5 years old, but only began
                my work with more comprehensive plotlines around age 12. At age 15 I began writing
                my first full novel; I completed it at age 17 with a word count of 110,000. I posted 
                chapter by chapter online until completion - since then it has gained 7.8 million
                reads, while my account has accumulated over 9000 followers. I've gone on to start more
                books (although they are on hiatus at the moment since I don't have the time for them), but the 
                book that I am excited for is called "The Curse of a Common Name." This is the first 
                book that I truly wanted to publish and I still hope to make that dream a reality in the near future.
                Below is the book cover that I made for it, complete with pen name. (PS: please ignore
                the subtitle at the top of the cover- I will not be posting any parts of this book with this cover).

            <p class='p flex-spot'>Another book I am one day planning to write is called <em>Tales
                of an Internet Child</em>. I was inspired by those random parenting advice
                posts you come across on the Internet every now and then, and thought it would
                be interesting to hear from somebody whose parents did all those things.</p>
