            <div class='book'><img class='rec' src="images/recommend/fireandflood.jpg" alt="Fire and Flood, Victoria Scott">
                <p>One of my favorite YA novels! Follow protagonist Tella Holloway as she navigates the harshest terrains
                    with the help of a strange fox in an attempt to save her brother.
                </p>
            <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/lemoncello.jpg" alt="Escape From Mr. Lemoncello's Library, Chris Grabenstein">
            <p>A fun, easy read that will make you with all libraries could be this cool! Follow Kyle Keely and his friends 
                as they crack ciphers, solve puzzles, and search for an exit from this library lock-in.
            </p>
            <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/montecristo.jpg" alt="The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas">
            <p>Honestly, my all-time favorite book. Highly recommend if you love betrayal, revenge, Napoleon-era France, 
                and multiple intertwining plots. The love story is one of the saddest ones out there, where you just can't help
                but feel bad for those characters involved.
            </p>
            <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/whenyoureachme.jpeg" alt="When You Reach Me, Rebecca Stead">
            <p>One of the more confusing books in my repertoire. A twisting tale of time travel, characters with more depth
                than first appearance would suggest, and an ending that you won't see coming. Highly worth the time needed to 
                understand.

            <div class='movie'><img class='rec' src="images/recommend/whitechicks.jpg" alt="White Chicks (2004)">
                <p>A classic that will never fail to make you laugh. Two FBI agents go undercover at
                    the Hamptons- and their blonde wigs are fantastic.
                </p>
            <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/coraline.jpg" alt="Coraline (2009)">
            <p>Definitely one of the scarier movies of my childhood. The animation is spectacular, the plot
                twists in unexpected ways, and there are Easter eggs hidden throughout the movie. Did you ever
                have a doll with button eyes? You might want to think twice about it after watching this movie.
            </p>
            <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/Interstellar.jpg" alt="Interstellar (2014)">
            <p>One of the most beautiful movies I have seen. I cried so many times, but even the saddest parts
                couldn't take away from the masterful soundtrack and delicate yet intriguing plot. If you like
                deep space exploration, time distortion, family, and wormholes, you'd better reserve 3 hours to 
                enjoy your trip orbiting a black hole.
            </p>
            <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/thepursuitofhappyness.png" alt="The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)">
            <p>Again, another tear jerker. Based off a true story, this movie is simultaneously inspiring and
                heartbreaking. I think it's definitely worth a watch.
            </p>

            <div class='show'>
                <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/psych.jpg" alt="Psych (Peacock)">
                    <p>Hilarity, action, mystery, and some very impressive detective work- you can't help but root
                    for Shawn Spencer, Chief "Psychic" of the Santa Barbara Police Department. This show has 
                    compelling characters, believable plot, and the odd bit of romance here and there.</p>
                <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/gravityfalls.jpg" alt="Gravity Falls (Disney+)">
                    <p>One of the most grown-up kids' TV shows out there, in my opinion. What seems like a fun
                show about two twins living with their eccentric uncle in the middle of Nowhere, Oregon for
                the summer quickly turns into a deep mystery full of weird creatures and interdimensional threats.
                Features a plot twist and magnificent Easter eggs - I cannot recommend this show enough, even 
                for older crowds.</p>
                <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/community.jpg" alt="Community (Netflix)">
                    <p>This is a show I only recently discovered, but very quickly got sucked into. The episode
                    continuity is amazing and I couldn't think of a better group of characters to have
                    ended up friends. Episodes go by quickly and are always good for a laugh.</p>
                <img class='rec' src="images/recommend/disenchantment.jpg" alt="Disenchantment (Netflix)">
                    <p>Talk about Easter eggs and mystery! If you need a description of Tiabeanie (Bean), just
                    picture a Disney princess with a drinking problem. There's never a dull moment on 
                    the adventures she and her friends, an elf and a demon, go on together.</p>
